## Description
Advetour is an application that provides travel-related information to customers acting like an easy access tour guide that tells you where to go, what to see and where to eat. It offers the user a chance to plan their trips at moments notice without having to access too maney materials for the perfect site. We here at Adventour not only want you to have a good time but we like you to also discover beautiful locations that bigger similar service providers usually overlook. We value quality and our clients wanting their trips to be memorable.

Adventour iterates and fetches three seperate lists of data from the API and shows them as pop cards on each seperate page.

The app also provides client-side routing.

The user is able to log in to access varius components via conditional rendering.

The user is able to add a like on a destination they enjoyed visiting which in turn updates on the UI
